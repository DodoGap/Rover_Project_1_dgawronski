## Project: Search and Sample Return
### Writeup Template: You can use this file as a template for your writeup if you want to submit it as a markdown file, but feel free to use some other method and submit a pdf if you prefer.

**To finish the Project I made the following actions:**  


**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* I added the same functions to Jupyter Notebook, and file `perception.py` named `find_rocks` which is similar to function `color_thershold`, because is choosing out the rocks color and returning 'black and white' image with selected rock. If function `find_rocks` is returning any data, map is filled with square which is position of finded rock.
* I modified function `process_image()` to transform images into view from isometric perspective, I add color threshold with masked view of camera to overcome unnecessary pixels, which is defined in `perspect_transform`. `perception.py` is also reading current position of rover and mapping it to world map, what is seen as red and blue colour on map

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.
Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 
And another!

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

#### 1. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.


#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
